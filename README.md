# Smart Speed Breaker System for Night Driving

This project provides a voice alert to drivers when a speed breaker is detected at night.

## Problem Statement
Speed breakers are often not visible at night, which may cause accidents.

## Solution
An IoT-based system detects the speed breaker and alerts the driver using sound or voice output.

## Components Used
- Arduino
- IR Sensor / Ultrasonic Sensor
- Buzzer / Speaker
- Power Supply

## Working
The sensor detects the speed breaker.
Arduino processes the signal and triggers an alert.

## Applications
- Night driving safety
- Accident prevention
